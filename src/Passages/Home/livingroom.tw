        //You start to have hunger, so maybe your phone could tell you where to buy some ingredients and learn a recipe. Oh and remember to download the map of the city so you know where everything is ;).//

        You pull out your phone from your pocket and start searching where to buy food. After some time you see an AD about a grocery shop.

    You are in your living room. From here you can see the door that goes to the front door and the garden. In one of the sides you can see your kitchen. Next to the door you have a @@.orange;normal tv@@ and a @@.orange;cheap sofa@@. /% Normal and cheap sofa probably can be upgradable. %/
    <br>
    You can see two more doors, one goes to your bedroom and the others goes to the bathroom. You see the wall clock, the time is @@.green;<<convert12h>>@@
