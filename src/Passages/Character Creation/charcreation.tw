<br>
<br>
// "Hey <<print $playername >>, we hope that you arrived well. We are really happy that you made this decision and we really hope that you use it to choose what you want to do in your life.

We deposited some money in your account so you can buy some food and maybe some clothes, you will need to clean the house as we haven't gone there since we started to live here. Oh, and please check if there is anything that needs to be repaired. That's all, bye and take care!"
